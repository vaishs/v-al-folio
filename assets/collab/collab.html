	<h2><strong>Working with me</p></h2>
</header>

<hr style="border: 1px dashed; color: orange" />
I am looking for students to work with me on various problems related to symbolic analysis and formal verification. You must have a demonstrable interest in theoretical problems, and an ability to read, write, and present technical proofs. You must also have studied and got at least a B+ or above in courses on discrete maths, theory of computation, automata theory, and algorithms. It is a plus if you have a working knowledge of one or more of: logic, verification, and functional programming.

<br><br>

Here is a tentative list of potential ideas for projects of various kinds. <br>

<ul>
    <li>Surveying the use of choreographies in distributed systems</li>
    <li>Identifying typing systems that guarantee security</li>
    <li>Uniformizing decidability results for security protocol verification</li>
    <li>Investigating a constraint system formalism for security protocol verification</li>
    <li>Extending the Tamarin tool for automated verification to handle new models</li>
    <li>Studying security protocol verification in the presence of a rational adversary</li>
</ul>

If you are interested in joining as an MS(R) or PhD student, see the relevant details <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/index.php/2011-12-29-22-45-50/degree-programs/ms-program" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/index.php/2011-12-29-22-45-50/degree-programs/phd-program" target="_blank">here</a> respectively. Please apply through <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/pg-admissions.php" target="_blank">IIT Delhi admissions process</a>, specifying formal verification as a research interest, and mention my name as a potential supervisor.

If you are an undergraduate student and looking for a BTech Project (IITD students only) or an internship (non-IITD students only), write a mail to me providing your IITD entry number (if available), attaching a CV, and listing your relevant background and which project you are interested in. In order for my spam filter to not reject your mail outright, make sure that your subject line contains the word "Belgium".
