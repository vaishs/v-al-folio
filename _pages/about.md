I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I work with <a href="https://owenarden.github.io/home" target="_blank">Owen Arden</a> on the formal verification of security protocols involving authorization and information flow. I am mostly interested in the application of formal methods and logic to disparate fields like security protocols and machine learning.

I completed my PhD at <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in" target="_blank">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/~jam/" target="_blank">R Ramanujam</a> and <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in/~spsuresh" target="_blank">S P Suresh</a>. I worked on the formal modelling and verification of security protocols involving certification. After my PhD, I did a postdoc at <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr" target="_blank">CNRS, France</a>, and then worked at <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/careers/research" target="_blank">Ericsson Research</a>.
